                <h3>History of the Magic</h3>
                <p> The oldest pub in London, as any wizard will tell you, is the Leaky Cauldron on Charing Cross Road. The Leaky Cauldron was there long before Charing Cross Road was even planned; its true address is number one, <a href="#">Diagon Alley</a>, and it is believed to have been built some time in the early 1500s, along with the rest of the wizarding street. The Leaky Cauldron was initially visible to Muggle eyes. While the pub was, from the first, a place for witches and wizards to congregate - Muggles were not turned away or made to feel unwelcome, even though some of the conversations, not to mention pets, caused many an unwary drinker to leave without finishing his mead.</p>
                <p>When the Statute of Secrecy was imposed, the Leaky Cauldron, great British wizarding institution that it had become, was granted special dispensation to continue its existence as a safe haven and refuge for wizardkind in the capital. The landlord of the day was given responsibility for letting people into <a href="#">Diagon Alley</a> from his back yard, for the shops beyond the pub were now also in need of magical protection.</p>
                <p>To honour Gamp's protection of the pub, the landlord created a new brand of beer, Gamp's Old Gregarious, which tasted so disgusting that nobody has ever been known to finish a pint (there is a one hundred Galleon prize to anyone prepared to do so, but nobody has yet succeeded in claiming the gold).</p>
