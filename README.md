### I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

###Comments:
I could not get the Google Maps javascript to stop throwing errors. I also was not able to find a decent jQuery plugin for animating objects to fly around the background. The page loading screen was my alternative. I also could not get the menu to work correctly without layer ul's inside of ul's, and it shows an error in the validator.
